                <li>Place the patties on the grill and cook for about 4-5 minutes per side, or until they reach your desired level of doneness.</li>

    <h3>Tips for the Perfect Burger:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Don't overwork the meat: Gently form the patties, avoiding over-mixing, to prevent tough burgers.</li>
        <li>Don't press down on the patties: Resist the urge to press down on the patties with a spatula, as this can cause the juices to escape.</li>
        <li>Let the meat rest: After cooking, let the patties rest for a few minutes before assembling the burgers. This allows the juices to redistribute.</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Make it your own!</h3>
    <p>ou may also want to consider adding bacon, pickles, or other condiments to your burgers. 
        Adjust the quantities based on your preferences and the number of servings.</p>
